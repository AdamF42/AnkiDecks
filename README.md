# Personal Programming Anki Decks

This repository contains my collection of Anki flashcard decks used to study various programming topics. 

## Repository Description

A curated collection of personal Anki flashcard decks focusing on programming concepts, languages, and technologies. This centralised repository for my study materials allows easy access and version control of my learning resources.

## Deck Contents

Each directory contains one or more `.apkg` files, which are the Anki package files for the flashcard decks. The decks cover various aspects of programming, including but not limited to:

- Programming language syntax and best practices
- Computer science concepts
- Data structures and algorithms
- Design patterns
- Software development methodologies
- Tools and technologies used in software development

## Using the Flashcards

To use these flashcard decks:

1. Clone this repository or download the desired `.apkg` file
2. Open Anki on your device
3. Click "File" > "Import" and select the downloaded `.apkg` file
4. The flashcards will now be available in your Anki collection

## Updating and Maintaining Decks

As I continue to learn and expand my knowledge, I'll update these decks regularly. To keep your local copy up to date:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Re-import the updated `.apkg` files into Anki

## Personal Use Notice

While this repository is public, these decks are primarily for my personal use. They reflect my learning journey and may contain personalized notes or mnemonics. Feel free to use them if you find them helpful, but keep in mind they're tailored to my learning style and needs.
